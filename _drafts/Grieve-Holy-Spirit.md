### Where is this verse which states such theology?

Where is this verse, if there really is one, in the Bible: "The Holy Spirit will leave you if you grieve Him," or "You will lose your salvation if you grieve the Holy Spirit." Or something to that effect. What if you can't find it anywhere in the Bible? Then wouldn't it logically follow that whatever this belief is it is just ... another gospel?

### <cite>Ephesians 4:30</cite> - what does it really say?

Well, there is actually one verse that has the phrase "grieve the Holy Spirit" in it - Ephesians 4:30:

> And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption (New Living Translation).<br /><br />
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption (NIV).<br /><br />
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption (KJV).

This verse, in all three different translations, obviously admonishes us that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit, but I cannot from reading it find the part where it says either you will lose your salvation or the Holy Spirit will leave you.

On the contrary, the verse in any of the translations above shows the Holy Spirit is given to you as a permanent seal for that wonderful day of redemption.

This verse might be paraphrased for better clarity as follows:

<p class="blockquote">God has given you the great seal of the Holy Spirit to guarantee your entry into God's Kingdom, so please do not grieve Him.</p>

### Our relationship with God as "Abba"

> <sup>6</sup>And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls <u>“Abba! Father!”</u> <sup>7</sup>So <u>you are no longer a slave but a son</u>, and if you are a son, then you are also an heir through God.
(Ephesians 4:6-7)

These verses preceeded the "grieving the Holy Spirit" verse which shows the kind of relationship we have with God: Father and Son. We are <u>"NO LONGER"</u> slaves but sons. This truth further sets the foundation upon which we can determine that the role of the Holy Spirit as a seal of our redemption is <u>"once for all."</u> It's a done deal.

### Gleaning from human relationship

There is no loving human father who would tell his son "Don't grieve me or I'll disown you." The disobedient son may have to suffer the consequences of his action, either by the father or by society, but his relationship to his father doesn't change. The prodigal son sure grieved his father greatly, but disowning him was the furthest thing from his mind. On the contrary, he daily went to the gate looking longingly toward the horizon hoping to see the familiar figure appearing and running into his loving arms.

God is infinitely more loving and and patient than anyone on earth. Contrary to human fathers who may be both selfish and insecure, God gives us the assurance of our sonship with Him without condition.

> <sup>11</sup>“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? <sup>12</sup>Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? <sup>13</sup>If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, <u>how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!</u>” (Luke 11:11-13)

Therefore the giving of the Holy Spirit as a seal of redemption is not conditional upon the ability of the believers to not grieving Him -the fact is they all will grieve the Holy Spirit- but rather because they're given such great irrevocable gift they ought to conduct their lives accordingly.

### Seventy times seven

> <sup>21</sup>Then Peter came and said to Him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" <sup>22</sup>Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. (Matthew 18:21-22)

In human relationship, one party grieves another is just a fact of life. Even the apostle Paul admits that the good things he wanted to do, he didn't, but instead he did the bad things that he didn't want to do. Do we expect to do better with the Holy Spirit?

Jesus assuaged His disciples in the verse above by showing them the extent of God's forgiveness. If he expected Peter to forgive seventy times seven, wouldn't He be able to forgive 7 hundred million times seven? That was exactly what He did, ahead of time for all the sins of mankind since the beginning of time and to the end of the ages.

And if he did so for the entire human race, how about me? Will he be able to forgive me for grieving His heart? Of course, because if I don't believe so I must be saying Jesus lied. But God cannot lie, and His promise will forever be true.
