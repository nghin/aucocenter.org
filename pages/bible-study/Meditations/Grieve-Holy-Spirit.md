### Where is this verse which states such theology?

Where is this verse, if there really is one, in the Bible: "The Holy Spirit will leave you if you grieve Him," or "You will lose your salvation if you grieve the Holy Spirit." Or something to that effect. What if you can't find it anywhere in the Bible? Then wouldn't it logically follow that whatever this belief is it is just ... another gospel?

### <cite>Ephesians 4:30</cite> - what does it really say?

Well, there is actually one verse that has the phrase "grieve the Holy Spirit" in it - Ephesians 4:30:

> &mdash;And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption (New Living Translation).<br />
&mdash;And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption (NIV).<br />
&mdash;And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption (KJV).

This verse, in all three different translations, obviously admonishes us that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit, but I cannot from reading it find the part where it says if you do grieve Him, you will either lose your salvation or the Holy Spirit will leave you.

On the contrary, the verse in any of the translations above shows the Holy Spirit is given to you as a permanent seal for that wonderful day of redemption.

This verse might be paraphrased for better clarity as follows:

<p class="blockquote">Since God has given you the great seal of the Holy Spirit to guarantee your entry into God's Kingdom, do not grieve Him.</p>

Let us check this point of theology against other foundational truths to see if it will stand up against the test of sound biblical exegesis -a study of the Bible in context.

### Our relationship with God as "Abba"

> <sup>6</sup>And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls <u>“Abba! Father!”</u> <sup>7</sup>So <u>you are no longer a slave but a son</u>, and if you are a son, then you are also an heir through God. (Galatians 4:6-7)

These verses preceeded the "grieving the Holy Spirit" verse which shows the kind of relationship we have with God: Father and Son. We are <u>"NO LONGER"</u> slaves but sons. This truth further sets the foundation upon which we can determine that the role of the Holy Spirit as a seal of our redemption is <u>"once for all."</u> It's a done deal.

### Gleaning from human relationship

There is no loving human father who would tell his son "Don't grieve me or I'll disown you." The disobedient son may have to suffer the consequences of his action, either by the father or by society, but his relationship to his father doesn't change. The prodigal son grieved his father greatly, but disowning him was the furthest thing from the father's mind. On the contrary, he daily went to the gate looking longingly toward the horizon hoping to see the familiar figure appearing and running into his loving arms.

God is infinitely more loving and and patient than anyone on earth. Contrary to human fathers who may be both selfish and insecure, God gives us the assurance of our sonship with Him without condition.

> <sup>11</sup>“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? <sup>12</sup>Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? <sup>13</sup>If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, <u>how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!</u>” (Luke 11:11-13)

Therefore the giving of the Holy Spirit as a seal of redemption is not conditional upon the ability of the believers to not grieving Him -the fact is they all will grieve the Holy Spirit- but rather because they're given such great irrevocable gift they ought to conduct their lives accordingly.

### Seventy times seven

> <sup>21</sup>Then Peter came and said to Him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" <sup>22</sup>Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. (Matthew 18:21-22)

In human relationship, one party grieves another is just a fact of life. Even the apostle Paul admits that the good things he wanted to do, he didn't, but instead he did the bad things that he didn't want to do. Do we expect to do better with the Holy Spirit?

Jesus assuaged His disciples in the verse above by showing them the extent of God's forgiveness. If he expected Peter to forgive seventy times seven, wouldn't He be able to forgive seven hundred million times seven? That was exactly what He did, ahead of time for all the sins of mankind since the beginning of time and to the end of the ages.

And if he did so for the entire human race, how about me? Will He be able to forgive me for grieving His heart? Of course He will, because if I don't believe so I must be saying Jesus lied. But God cannot lie, and His promise will forever be true.

### The real offense against the Holy Spirit

> <sup>31</sup> For this reason I tell you, people will be forgiven for <u>every sin</u> and <u>blasphemy (NIV: slander)</u>, but the <u>blasphemy against the Spirit</u> will not be forgiven. <sup>32</sup> Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. (Matthew 12:31-32 - NET Bible)

Every sin can be forgiven, except one: blaspheming, or slandering, the Holy Spirit. We can see clearly that all manner of sins great and small are NOT of the unforgivable one above. All sins grieve the Holy Spirit, but there is only one that in unforgivable. What do you think this sin is? Murder? Adultary? Lustful thoughts? Remaining angry past sunset? Not keeping the Sabbath? Greed? No, none of the above, because Jesus said that <u>every sin</u> is forgivable, except of course the ONLY one. It's eternally important that we know what this unforgivable sin is.

Here's an excerpt from the HELPS Word-studies: <span style="color: #008000;">Blasphemy (988 /blasphēmía) "switches" right for wrong (wrong for right), i.e. calls what God disapproves, "right" which "exchanges the truth of God for a lie" (Ro 1:25)</span> (source: <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/988.htm">Strong's Greek: 988. βλασφημία (blasphémia) -- slander</a>) 

We must keep in mind that blasphemy in itself is not unforgivable -read verse 31 above, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is. The NIV's translation uses the word <u>slander</u> in place of blasphemy which may give a more accurate contextual meaning. The HELPS Word-studies gives us "<u>switches right for wrong, or conversely wrong for right</u>." All in relation to the Holy Spirit. There is something the Holy Spirit says or does which gets slandered, distorted, its meaning turned upside down, most likely with the intention of rendering it void.

If blasphemy is simply irreverance, calling names, disrespect, or foul language, it surely will grieve the Holy Spirit but affect no one else except the trespasser. But if blasphemy is a slander, a distortion of the Holy Spirit's message of salvation, it may have eternal consequences on others.

### What is the principal role of the Holy Spirit?

> <sup>7</sup> But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I am going away. For if I do not go away, <u>the Advocate</u> will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you. <sup>8</sup> And when he comes, he will <u>prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment</u> - <sup>9</sup> <u>concerning sin, because they do not believe in me</u>; <sup>10</sup> concerning <u>righteousness</u>, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; <sup>11</sup> and concerning <u>judgment</u>, because the ruler of this world has been condemned. (John 16:8-11)

The Advocate in verse 7 above is the Holy Spirit. Jesus explains what He does when He comes, that He will do 3 things, all of which may give us clue as to what action against his purpose may be considered an unforgivable sin.

### Concerning sin

How is the world wrong concerning sin? How are you dealing with sin? In general, Christians or unbelievers alike, we do our best not to sin, not to do the things we shouldn't do, and do the things we should. In the event we fail, we pay for our failures through some sacrifices, confessions, offerings, show remorse, etc. But Jesus said this is the wrong way to deal with sin, because it will be a never-ending treadmill of failures and contrition only to be repeated over and over again.

Jesus pointed out that one of the principal thing the Holy Spirit does is He shows mankind <u>the true definition of sin: not believing in Jesus.</u>

Why is this the truth about sin? Not only men cannot stop sinning, they cannot stop being sinful. Even if they manage to not committing any sin known to man, they cannot rid themselves of their sin nature. If we continue to deal with the problem of sin the way the world does, we'd remain in sin, but if we believe what Jesus said about the Holy Spirit and simply believe in Him, sin will no longer be our master.

### Concerning righteousness

The Bible defines sin as a state of falling short of God's righteousness. We all are in need of this righteousness so our relationship with Him can be restored. Here is where the world, including a large percentage of Christianity, is wrong about how we get that righteousness. Paul wrote his major epistles to steer the believers from the mistaken notion that they could get that righteousness by the works of the law.

Jesus pointed out the second objective of the Holy Spirit is to correct another wrong idea about how we can get right (righteousness) with God: <u>We get right with God becaused Jesus went to the Father as our Attorney at Law to plead for us that all payment had been paid for</u>. Whatever relationship He has with the Father -and we know it is a Trinity relationship where Jesus and the Father are one- we also inherit that because we are in Christ.

### Concerning judgment

All of mankind awaits the day of reckoning when they must meet the Creator. This is why we came to the foot of the cross in order to face that day not as condemned sinners, but as children of God. And God has provided for us a way out by giving His own Son as a payment for our sin.

Jesus pointed out the third objective of the Holy Spirit is to show us that the dreadful judgement is reserved only for the "ruler of this world," and of course those who belong to him. And we all know that we belong to Christ, therefore <u>judgement is never intended for us</u>.

<p class="blockquote"> <sup>1</sup> There is therefore now <u>no condemnation</u> for those who are in Christ Jesus. <sup>2</sup> For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death. <sup>3</sup> For God achieved what the law could not do because it was weakened through the flesh. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, <sup>4</sup> so that the <u>righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us</u>, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. (Romans 8:1-4)</p> 

### Conclusion

The goal of the Holy Spirit when He comes is -He's already come in the hearts of all who are in Christ- to make sure we understand:

- Sin is: <u>not believing in Jesus</u>
- <u>Righteousness is our</u>s: because Jesus is pleading for us at the right hand of God
- <u>Judgment is not for believers</u>, but for the prince of this world and those who belong to him

Those who blaspheme, or slander, the Holy Spirit are those who distort the Holy Spirit's main objective, or minimize the effectiveness of His message. Those are folks who commit the unpardonable sin.

The belief that the grieving of the Holy Spirit is an unforgivable sin is not found in the Bible, and goes against all foundational truths scatered throughout Scriptures. As we have already discussed earlier, if grieving God is truly unforgivable, no one will be saved.

Those who hold such belief may in fact still live under the law, and the law says that "the soul that sins [grieve the Holy Spirit] shall die" (Ezekiel 18:20). And for those who still want to keep the law, James 2:10 says this:

<p class="blockquote">For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</p>

It logically follows that those who live by the law, will break the entire law all the time, because as long as you still live in the flesh, you will break some law some time, and based on James 2:10, you are a continual lawbreaker, and you are a Spirit griever all the time.

What a dreadful way to relate to God!

To live under grace is the only way to secure our salvation, the only way to move forward. It is the only way to live for a child of God. <u>To think that there is anything that can render void the power of the cross of Christ is to live in unbelief, and that is sin</u>.

> “<sup>17</sup>Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.” <sup>18</sup>And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary. (Hebrews 10:17-18; Hebrews 10:29)
